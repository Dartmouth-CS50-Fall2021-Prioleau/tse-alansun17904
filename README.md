## CS50 Fall 2021, Tiny Search Engine

GitHub username: alansun17904

This project represents an attempt to create a tiny search engine. It contains
three main components: a crawler, an indexer, and a query function. These are
implemented as distinct parts, however, note that they all rely on each other.

As such, the detailed descriptions of each of these parts are located in the `README.md`
of the subdirectory of each part.
